Data underlying the forecasts are not observed:
Treat individual forecasts like any other conditioning information (data) and
estimate the best possible mapping from the forecasts to the outcome
2 Data underlying the model forecasts is observed: ëmodel combinationí
Using a middle step of Örst constructing forecasts limits the áexibility of the
Önal forecasting model. Why not directly map the underlying data to the
forecasts?
Estimation error plays a key role in the risk of any given method. Model
combination yields a risk function which, through parsimonious use of the
data, could result in an attractive risk function
Combined forecast can be viewed simply as a di§erent estimator of the Önal
model

Combinations of forecasts: theory
Restrict conditioning information to a set of m forecasts
zt = fˆf1t+hjt
, ....,
ˆfmt+hjt g
The optimal combination is the function of the forecasts

) that solves

Optimality of the combined forecast is conditional on observing the forecasts

ˆfmt+hjt g rather than the underlying information sets used
to construct the forecasts
If the model f (.) is a linear index, the combination is a linear combination
with weights ω1, ..., ωm

Combinations of forecasts: theory
Specialized concepts in optimal forecast combination arise from additional
restrictions placed on the search for combination models
Because the underlying ëdataíare forecasts, they can be expected to obtain
non-negative weights that sum to unity,
